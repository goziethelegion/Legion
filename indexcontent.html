   <H3>Week 5 - Project Budget</H3>
   <p align="justify">The project budget was due this week. I was lagging behind. I hadn't done my research on what hardware parts my project required. On that Monday class, i started my research and i had it completed before the end of class. I had to show Mr. Kristian my budget for approval. After he reviewed my budget, he advised me to hold off on some of the parts i wanted to buy. Below are my project budget proposal:</p>

	<p align="justify">In the previous week, i had to edit my PCB schematic and also had to send an email requesting for one.</p>
   <H3>Week 4 - Project Schedule (Gantt Chart)</H3>
  <p align="justify">In the previous week, i had to submit my project proposal for my hardware project course and my software project course as well. For my software project, me and my group members had to have a project interview with Mr. Sharifi for approval. After interviewing with Mr. Sharifi, he basically assigned us a whole new project after arguing that our hardware projects doesn't align. Well at least we got a project approval amidst of a hundred project disapprovals. Now we had a whole new project to do and i had a due assignment. I started my assignment late but i had it done eventually. You would find that i have multiple copies of it and that is because i used ProjectLibre to make my Gantt chart initially.</p>

   <H3>Week 3 - Project Proposal</H3>
  <p align="justify">My project proposal was due this week. Myself, Mykal and Bradey had to reach a consesus because the due date for the proposal was at hand. Initially, we planned to focus on a greenhouse farm. I was supposed to make a device that sat underneath the soil and monitored the state of a crop internally (basically its root and other growth determinant factor) and notify the crop farmer when the crop is good for harvest, while Mykal was supposed to make a camera that monitors the growth of a crop by its length with the same purpose of notifying the farmer when the crop is good for harvest. Bradey was to focus on making a device that monitored the external factors like weather, that affected the growth of crops. I got to see Mykal's proposal after his submission. It was a general as compared to our agreement. Thereafter, i decided to do something different as we all thought our initial plan would be too difficult to build, if we were ever successful in building it. Below is my submitted project proposal</p>

  <H3>Week 2 - Github Installation and Repository Setup</H3>
  <p align="justify">In the first week of class, we had a simple quiz and a course introduction afterwards. After lectures we had to setup a github account according to the steps provided by Mr. Kristian Medri. I had my repository setup as well and named it Legion. Mr. Medri also had the whole class being creative about their upcoming project proposal. I had to choose a hardware project that had to align with my other software project course with Mr. Haki Sharifi. Initially, i thought the project was supposed to be a group project but after lectures i got to learn it was an individual project. I already had a group with Mykal Bailey and Bradey Brito-Garcia(NoirTech) for the software project course. Our software project was supposed to align with the hardware project so that we don't have to do extra work for next semester. In other words, eventhough my hardware project is supposed to be different from Bradey's and Mykal's hardware project, all 3 hardware projects are supposed to share one software application. After class, i had to setup a WhatsApp group with Bradey and Mykal for easier communication. We agreed to meet up during the coming week to discuss on what our projects was going to be.</p>
